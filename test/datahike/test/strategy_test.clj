  "This function constructs tx-data for a forest of concepts in a terminology, 
  for example a labor market terminology of occupations. The edges in the
  forest point toward the root and are labeled `:concept/broader` because the
  closer to the root we get, the broader the concept is. For instance, we could
  have a concept for the occupation name 'Software Engineer' and an edge from 
  that concept pointing at a broader concept 'Occuptions in Computer Science'.

  This function takes as input a concatenated list of pairs of `m` and `t`
  on the form `[m1 t1 m2 t2 ... mN tN]` that specifies how many sub nodes
  should be generated at each level from the root and the type. For example,
  `[5 'ssyk-level-1' 3 'ssyk-level-2']` means that we will construct 5 trees
  of root node type 'ssyk-level-1' and each one of them will have 3 children
  of node type 'ssyk-level-2'."

some concept ids, we look up broader concepts. The queries in this test will
include clauses with up to two unknown variables.

We perform two queries. In the first query, we only provide one input id and
look up concepts broader than that id. Here, we expect all strategies except
identity to perform well because there will always be some substitutions to be made.

In the second query, we provide two input ids. This means that the select-simple
strategy will not perform the substitution that it performed in the first case where
we only had one one input id. Therefore, it will perform about as bad as identity."

  "This test is designed for the select-all strategy to perform well. We construct a 
forest of four trees with each tree having 2000 subnodes each. We then pick the ids
of two of the root nodes of the trees and the ids from three of the children of one 
trees. Then we we query for all (parent,child) pairs.

The select-all strategy is going to expand the `[?cc :concept/broader ?pc]` to the 
6 = 2*3 combinations of the possible parent child pairs and consequently make six
queries to the database backend. Each such query will return either one or zero rows.

The expand-once strategy will only substitude the `?pc` variable in the 
`[?cc :concept/broader ?pc]` pattern because `?pc` has the smallest number of
possible bindings, that is two. So it will make two database lookups. Each one of 
those lookups will result in 2000 rows returned from the database backend and most 
of those rows will be discarded. So it will be slower.

Finally, the select-simple and identity strategies will both run the query
`[?cc :concept/broader ?pc]` without any substitutions which will return 8000 rows
to be filtered."
